## Blynk Project Setup

**Project Name and Auth Token**

When you create a new project in the Blynk app, you'll be prompted to enter a name for your project (choose something descriptive that reflects its purpose). The app will also provide you with a unique **auth token**. This token is crucial for establishing communication between your Arduino or Raspberry Pi and the Blynk cloud. You'll need to include this token in your Python code within the `BLYNK_AUTH` variable.

**Temple ID and Device Name (Optional)**

While not strictly necessary for code functionality, the Blynk app offers optional configuration options at the project level: Temple ID and Device Name. These settings become particularly useful when you're managing multiple devices within a single project. They help differentiate your devices for better organization and clarity within the Blynk app.

**Using Multiple Devices in Your Blynk Project**

If you're planning to use multiple devices within a single Blynk project, consider leveraging Temple ID and Device Name to distinguish them effectively within the Blynk app. While this approach doesn't alter the core functionality of the provided code, it significantly enhances organization and clarity.

**Refer to the Blynk Documentation for the Latest Details**

For the most up-to-date information on Temple ID and Device Name configuration, as well as guidance on their usage within your Blynk project, we highly recommend consulting the official Blynk documentation: https://docs.blynk.io/en
